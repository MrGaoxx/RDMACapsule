# Introduction
RDMACapsule is a C++ RDMA library
The design goal of the library is the EASE of USAGE
Here are deisgn principles for the library:
1. the core of this library should not rely on any other libraries, including
    - RDMA core abstraction for the C interface, including Infiniband concepts, e.g., QPs, CQs
    - 
2. some functional modules can be optionally with open-source projects
    - event model (libev)
    - thread model

# Modules
## core: RDMA core abstraction

# Milestones
1. finish the core module
2.
